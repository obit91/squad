## Context

Squad's coordinator prompt (`squad.agent.md`) and agent charters (e.g.
`scribe-charter.md`) are shipped as templates in `.squad-templates/`. Changes to
these files affect how every squad session behaves — but unit tests can't catch
prompt-level regressions because the prompts are interpreted by an LLM at
runtime.

This skill describes how to validate template changes end-to-end by running real
squad sessions against a locally-built CLI that includes your modified templates.

## When To Use

- You changed `.squad-templates/squad.agent.md` (coordinator prompt)
- You changed `.squad-templates/scribe-charter.md` or other agent charters
- You changed `.squad-templates/notes-protocol.md` or helper scripts
- You added new conditional blocks (e.g. state-backend-aware spawn templates)
- You modified the init scaffolding that writes templates to target repos

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥20, **npm** ≥10
- **Git** CLI
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** (`copilot` or `ghcs`) installed
- A local clone of the squad repo on your feature branch

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Build the CLI from your branch

```bash
cd /path/to/squad          # your feature branch
npm install
npm run build              # compiles SDK + CLI

# Link so `squad` command uses your local build
cd packages/squad-cli
npm link
```

Verify: `squad version` should show the `-preview` tag.

### Step 2 — Create a disposable test repo

```bash
mkdir /tmp/sq-test-1 && cd /tmp/sq-test-1
git init
echo "# Test Project" > README.md
echo '{"name":"test-project","version":"1.0.0"}' > package.json
mkdir src
echo "export function hello() { return 'world' }" > src/index.ts
git add -A && git commit -m "init: test project"
```

Keep the project small — you only need enough for the coordinator to recognize a
codebase and hire a team.

### Step 3 — Init a squad with your modified templates

```bash
squad init
# If testing a specific feature (e.g. state backends):
# squad init --state-backend git-notes
```

Verify the init produced the expected files:
```bash
ls -la .squad/
cat .squad/team.md          # should have ## Members with 3+ agents
cat .squad/config.json      # should reflect any CLI flags you passed
```

### Step 4 — Run a real session and capture output

Use the Copilot CLI's `-p` flag for non-interactive single-turn sessions:

```bash
copilot --agent squad -p "Picard, decide what testing framework to use. Write your decision." \
  2>&1 | tee evidence/session-task.log
```

For multi-turn workflows, run sequential sessions:
```bash
# Session A: give the team a task
copilot --agent squad -p "prompt A" 2>&1 | tee evidence/session-A.log

# Session B: verify state persisted
copilot --agent squad -p "What decisions has the team made?" 2>&1 | tee evidence/session-B.log
```

### Step 5 — Verify the outcome

Check that your template change had the expected effect. Common checks:

```bash
# State location (for state-backend changes)
git notes --ref=squad list              # git-notes backend
git ls-tree -r squad-state              # orphan backend
ls .squad/agents/*/history.md           # worktree backend

# Coordinator behavior (grep session log)
grep "STATE_BACKEND" evidence/session-task.log
grep "spawn" evidence/session-task.log

# File tree diff
git diff --stat HEAD~1                  # what changed on working branch
git log --all --oneline                 # commits across all branches
```

### Step 6 — Record the verdict

Create an `evidence/verdict.md` in each test repo:

```markdown
## Test: [scenario name]
**Backend:** worktree | git-notes | orphan | two-layer
**Branch:** [your feature branch]
**Result:** PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL
**Duration:** Xm Ys

### What was verified
- [ ] Coordinator identified feature correctly (from session log)
- [ ] Agent was spawned via `task` tool (not simulated)
- [ ] team.md has ## Members with 3+ agents
- [ ] State landed in correct location
- [ ] No unexpected side effects

### Evidence files
- session-task.log — full session output
- git-log.txt — `git log --all --oneline`

### Notes
[anything unusual or noteworthy]
```

Record the wall-clock time from the start of Step 1 (fast-fail checks) to the end
of Step 6 (verdict posted). This is the full E2E run duration for this scenario.

## Progress Reporting

Use this section only when you are running E2E validation for an open PR. If
`PR_NUMBER` and `REPO` are both set, post and maintain a live tracking comment
in the PR thread. If either value is missing (for example, a local-only run),
skip progress reporting silently.

### Start the tracking comment before Step 1

1. Post a PR comment before Step 1 begins:

```bash
gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO" --body "## E2E Progress\n\n| Step | Status | Started | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Fast-fail checks (build · link · \\`squad version\\`) | ⏳ Pending | --:-- | -- |
| 2. Create test repo(s) | ⏳ Pending | --:-- | -- |
| 3. \\`squad init\\` + file verification | ⏳ Pending | --:-- | -- |
| 4. Run sessions | ⏳ Pending | --:-- | -- |
| 5. Verify outcomes | ⏳ Pending | --:-- | -- |
| 6. Record verdicts + post final comment | ⏳ Pending | --:-- | -- |
\n| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ⏳ | Not started |
| 🔄 | Running |
| ✅ | Passed |
| ❌ | Failed |
| ⚠️ | Passed with caveats |"
```

2. Capture the comment ID immediately after posting it:

```bash
COMMENT_ID=$(gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments" --jq '.[-1].id')
```

3. Treat Step 1 as in progress as soon as the comment exists. Update the body so
   Step 1 shows `🔄 Running` and every later step remains `⏳ Pending`.

### Update the tracking comment after every step boundary

1. When marking a step `🔄 Running`, record `$startTime = Get-Date` and store the
   `HH:MM` start time in that row's **Started** column.
2. Edit the existing comment in place; do not post a new progress comment:

```bash
gh api --method PATCH "repos/$REPO/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID" --field body="..."
```

3. When marking a step `✅`, `❌`, or `⚠️`, compute
   `$duration = (Get-Date) - $startTime` and format it as
   `"{0}m {1}s" -f [int]$duration.TotalMinutes, $duration.Seconds`.
4. Update the completed step row to `✅`, `❌`, or `⚠️`, keep its original
   `HH:MM` value in **Started**, and write the formatted duration in **Duration**.
5. Keep all previously completed rows unchanged.
6. Mark the next step as `🔄 Running` and set its **Started** value.
7. Leave later steps as `⏳ Pending` with `--:--` for **Started** and `--` for
   **Duration**.
8. If a step fails and you stop early, still update the comment so the failed step
   shows `❌` with its original start time and computed duration, and Step 6
   becomes `🔄 Running` while you prepare the final verdict.

### Use this status legend in the comment

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ⏳ | Not started |
| 🔄 | Running |
| ✅ | Passed |
| ❌ | Failed |
| ⚠️ | Passed with caveats |

### Use exact step names and order

Keep these six rows in this exact order every time you update the comment:

1. Fast-fail checks (build · link · `squad version`)
2. Create test repo(s)
3. `squad init` + file verification
4. Run sessions
5. Verify outcomes
6. Record verdicts + post final comment

### Handle Windows comment bodies safely

On Windows, avoid inline multi-line `--field body="..."` values. Use PowerShell
heredoc syntax to build the full body, write the JSON payload to a temporary file
inside the working repo, then pipe it with `--input -` to avoid shell escaping
issues. Follow the same caution as the PII Protection section: scrub any local
absolute paths before posting.

```powershell
$step1StartTime = Get-Date
$step1Started = $step1StartTime.ToString('HH:mm')
$step1Duration = (Get-Date) - $step1StartTime
$step1DurationText = "{0}m {1}s" -f [int]$step1Duration.TotalMinutes, $step1Duration.Seconds
$step2StartTime = Get-Date
$step2Started = $step2StartTime.ToString('HH:mm')
$body = @"

@{ body = $body } | ConvertTo-Json -Compress | Set-Content -Path $payloadPath -NoNewline
Get-Content $payloadPath -Raw | gh api --method PATCH "repos/$env:REPO/issues/comments/$env:COMMENT_ID" --input -
Remove-Item $payloadPath
```

### Replace the tracking comment with the final verdict

When you reach Step 6, replace the tracking comment body entirely with the final
structured verdict table. Do not post a separate final comment. The tracking
comment is the final verdict comment.

Include a summary row at the bottom of the final table showing the total elapsed
time for the full run:

```text
| **Total** | — | HH:MM | Xm Ys |
```

## Test Matrix Template

Use this matrix when planning validation for a template change. Not every change
needs every row — pick the scenarios relevant to your modification.

| # | Scenario | What to verify | Duration |
|---|----------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | Basic init + task | Templates applied, agent spawned, work produced | — |
| 2 | Cross-branch persistence | State survives `git checkout` (if state-backend) | — |
| 3 | Scribe behavior | Scribe commits to correct target | — |
| 4 | PR cleanliness | Feature branch PR has no leaked state files | — |
| 5 | Migration path | Existing squad picks up new template behavior | — |
| 6 | Edge case: empty repo | Init works in repo with single commit | — |
| 7 | Edge case: monorepo | Init works in subdirectory of monorepo | — |

Note: Keep `—` during planning, then replace it with the actual elapsed time when
recording the verdict for each scenario.

## Tips

- **Name test repos descriptively:** `sq-test-notes-crossbranch`, not `test1`.
- **Always capture session logs.** Without logs, you can't debug failures.
- **One scenario per repo.** Don't reuse repos across unrelated tests — state
  leaks between tests make results unreliable.
- **Clean up after.** Delete test repos when done. They accumulate fast.
- **Windows users:** Use PowerShell. `Tee-Object` replaces `tee`. Paths use `\`.

## Fast-Fail Rules

These checks must pass before running any scenario. If any fail, stop
immediately and report the failure — do **not** attempt workarounds or mark
scenarios as SKIPPED.

1. **Build must succeed.** Run `npm run build` from the repo root. A build
   failure blocks all scenarios; report `BUILD_FAILED` and stop.
2. **CLI must link successfully.** `cd packages/squad-cli && npm link` must exit
   0. If it fails, report `LINK_FAILED` and stop.
3. **`squad version` must run.** After linking, `squad version` must output a
   version string. If not, report `CLI_NOT_FOUND` and stop.

Do **not** mark scenarios as SKIPPED due to build or environment errors —
that obscures real failures from reviewers. SKIPPED is only acceptable when the
user explicitly requests it.

## PII Protection — Mandatory

When posting evidence to PR comments, issues, or any shared document:

- **Never include absolute paths** that contain a local username (e.g.,
  `C:\Users\username\...` or `/home/username/...`).
- **Use `~` notation** for home-relative paths: `~/AppData/Local/Temp/...`
  or `~/tmp/sq-test-1`.
- **Scrub before posting.** Replace any occurrence of the local machine path
  prefix (everything up to and including the username segment) with `~`.

Example — ❌ wrong: `C:\Users\johndoe\AppData\Local\Temp\sq-e2e-pr1035\evidence`
Example — ✅ right: `~/AppData/Local/Temp/sq-e2e-pr1035/evidence`

This applies to all evidence tables, verdict files, and PR comments.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Skipping the local build.** If you test with the published CLI, you're
  testing the old templates, not your changes.
- **Posting absolute paths in PR comments.** Always scrub to `~`-relative paths
  before sharing. See PII Protection above.
- **Marking scenarios SKIPPED due to environment issues.** Fix the environment
  (use fast-fail rules above) or report BUILD_FAILED — never silently skip.
- **Testing only the happy path.** Template changes often break edge cases (empty
  repos, monorepos, cross-branch). Test at least 2-3 scenarios.
- **Trusting session output alone.** Always verify git state independently —
  agents can claim they wrote something without actually doing it.
- **Reusing test repos.** Prior state bleeds into later tests. Start fresh.
